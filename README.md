# archer
###### Short prototype game using libgdx, featuring Warcraft 2 sprites and tiles!
## The Purpose
We were tasked to create a project to compete in a 24-hour long hackathon hosted at [<Academia de Código_>](https://www.academiadecodigo.org), ending up with this game and scoring the winning **3.45 / 5** score based on various criteria.

## The Goals We Set
#### Game Premise
> You are an archer, stuck in a dungeon with monsters, with limited health and arrows. You can pick up your arrows again to reuse them.
#### Minimum Requirements
- Movable player ✓
- Fireable projectiles ✓
- Enemies ✓
- At least two rooms
- Menu with options
- Restart and exit options
#### Possible Extra Features
- Keys and Locked Doors
- Limited Ammo
- Recyclable Ammo
- Boss Enemy
- Increasing Difficulty (more enemies, more health?)
- Configurable Difficulty (health and damage multiplier, more enemies?)
- Scoreboard (time taken and enemies killed)
- Randomly generated enemies
## The Overall Result
We were able to put out a working prototype but ended up struggling a lot with the animation system, which took some precious hours
to get the hang of. Having no experience on LibGdx, a great part of our work was based on the
[Super Mario clone tutorial by Code School on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8MPxzkwBwo&list=PLZm85UZQLd2SXQzsF-a0-pPF6IWDDdrXt),
 which although, in our opinion, not having the best structure for the kind of game we were aiming for, was more than good enough for us to
 meet most of our minimum goals.
 ## The Bottom Line
 This is just a reference repository. If you are looking to learn how to use libgdx, we strongly advise you to not use our code as a basis.
 The goal of this project was to reinforce teamwork and adaptability, relying upon our best skills and covering for each other's weaknesses, 
 which we were more than successful in achieving.
